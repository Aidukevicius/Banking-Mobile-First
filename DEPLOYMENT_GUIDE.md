## 🚀 Which Should You Choose?

### Choose **Railway** if:
- ✅ You're on a budget (free tier works great)
- ✅ This is your first deployment
- ✅ You want simplest setup (one place for app + database)
- ✅ You don't want to worry about timeouts
- ✅ **This is our recommendation for most users!**

👉 **Follow**: `DEPLOY_TO_RAILWAY.md`

---

### Choose **Vercel Pro** if:
- ✅ You need Vercel-specific features
- ✅ You're okay paying $20/month
- ✅ You already use Vercel for other projects
- ✅ You want global CDN for frontend

👉 **Follow**: `DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md`

---

### Avoid **Vercel Free** because:
- ❌ 10-second timeout is too short for database operations
- ❌ You'll get 504 errors on first request (cold start)
- ❌ Even with pooled connections, often not enough
- ❌ Frustrating experience with constant timeouts
