# How to Share This Project for Vercel Deployment

This guide explains how to share your Finance Tracker app so others can deploy it to their own Vercel account.

## What You're Sharing

When you share this project, people will be able to:
- Fork/clone your repository
- Deploy it to their own Vercel account
- Set up their own database and email service
- Customize the app for their needs

## Sharing Your Code

### Option 1: GitHub (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/finance-tracker.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. Share the GitHub repository URL with others

3. Others can then:
   - Click "Fork" on your GitHub repo
   - Follow the `DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md` guide to deploy to their Vercel account

### Option 2: Vercel Deploy Button
Create a README.md with a "Deploy to Vercel" button:

```markdown
# Finance Tracker

Smart money management with intelligent categorization

## Deploy Your Own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/finance-tracker)

### Required Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Random 64-character string
- `BREVO_API_KEY` - Brevo API key for emails
- `FROM_EMAIL` - Your verified Brevo email
- `FROM_NAME` - Display name for emails
- `BASE_URL` - Your Vercel deployment URL

See `DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md` for detailed setup instructions.
```

## What to Include in Your Repository

Make sure these files are in your repo:
- ‚úÖ `DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
- ‚úÖ `package.json` - Dependencies
- ‚úÖ All source code files

## What NOT to Share

**Never commit these files:**
- ‚ùå `.env` or `.env.local` - Contains your secrets
- ‚ùå `node_modules/` - Dependencies (installed during build)
- ‚ùå `dist/` - Build output (generated during deployment)
- ‚ùå `.vercel/` - Vercel deployment metadata

Make sure your `.gitignore` includes:
```
node_modules
.env
.env.local
dist
.vercel
```

## Instructions for Deployers

Include this in your README.md:

### For People Deploying Your App

1. **Fork or Clone** this repository
2. **Read** `DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md` for complete setup instructions
3. **Prepare** the following before deploying:
   - PostgreSQL database (Neon or Supabase recommended - free tier available)
   - Brevo account for sending emails (free tier available)
   - Vercel account (free tier available, but Pro recommended for production)

4. **Important**: The app requires environment variables to work. Make sure you set up ALL required variables before deploying (see Step 4 in `DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md`)

## Vercel Deployment Considerations

### Free Tier Limitations
- 10-second timeout limit (may cause 504 errors on complex operations)
- Good for testing and small personal use
- Database connection pooling is essential

### Pro Tier Benefits ($20/month)
- 60-second timeout (already configured in vercel.json)
- Better for production use
- More reliable for database-heavy operations

### Alternative: Free Deployment Options
If you want to avoid Vercel's free tier limitations, you can deploy to:
- **Railway.app** - No strict timeout limits, free tier available
- **Render.com** - 15-minute timeout on free tier
- **Fly.io** - Free tier available

See `DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md` for detailed pros/cons of each platform.

## Common Issues When Sharing

### Issue: "Build Failed"
**Solution**: Make sure package.json includes all required scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts",
    "build": "vite build",
    "build:server": "esbuild server/routes.ts ... --outdir=dist/server",
    "vercel-build": "npm run build && npm run build:server"
  }
}
```

### Issue: "504 Gateway Timeout"
**Solution**: See the "504 Gateway Timeout errors" section in `DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md`
- Use database connection pooling
- Consider upgrading to Vercel Pro
- Or deploy to Railway/Render instead

### Issue: "Missing Environment Variables"
**Solution**: Remind deployers to set ALL environment variables before deploying (see Step 4 in `DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md`)
